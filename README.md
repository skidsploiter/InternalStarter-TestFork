# The ultimative internal starter-base
## This is a test pls no judgeme

- Undetected GetLuaState

- comes with 80 sunc -- 90 unc
- level 8 (obviously)

## Why did i post this?
i actually made this to release it to public, since the LuaState changed destroyed some shitsploits. 
Now that Ronix used this module, i decided to early post it on github.

## What about Updates?
All offsets, Encryptions and Shuffles can be obtained on my discord server: discord.gg/getcloudy . if you are lucky, ill publish dumpers soon


## How do i even inject?
You will need an injector! i will post a new one the next days. As long as i didnt, take the one from my old internalbase.
